h1. RabbitMQ stress tests

h2. Getting started

You'd need to have Ruby and RubyGems installed. The recommended way is RVM since it is completely
isolated from the rest of the system and can be wiped out with one command (rvm implode).

Given you have Ruby 1.9.2 (it comes with RubyGems out of the box) installed via RVM, install Bundler:

    gem install bundler

and then pull down dependencies from the repository root:

    bundle install --local



h2. Running scripts

Run them prefixed with bundle exec:

    bundle exec ./script/[script name].rb
